# 🚨 Leak Alert – Infrastructure Leakage Reporting Platform

Leak Alert is a web-based application that enables citizens to report water and infrastructure leakages directly to local municipalities. The platform uses computer vision to verify image submissions, helping ensure accurate data collection. Leak Alert empowers the public to contribute to infrastructure maintenance and environmental sustainability while assisting municipalities with timely and data-driven responses.

## 🌐 Features

- 📸 **Leak Reporting**: Upload images or videos of infrastructure leaks (e.g., burst pipes, potholes, electrical hazards).
- 🧠 **Computer Vision Validation**: Automatically analyzes images using CV models to verify leak types and reduce false reports.
- 📝 **Form Submission**: Collects structured data such as location, description, type of leak, and date.
- 🗂️ **Database Logging**: Stores reports in a secure database for municipal access, analytics, and response planning.
- 📬 **Municipality Notifications**: (Optional future feature) Notify responsible departments based on the leak type and location.
- 🗺️ **Map View**: (Planned) Display reported leaks on a map for public awareness and infrastructure monitoring.

## 📸 Example Use Case

1. A citizen sees a water pipe leaking in their neighborhood.
2. They open the Leak Alert app, upload a photo of the issue, and submit a brief description.
3. The system checks the image using computer vision to confirm it's a valid leak.
4. The report is stored in a database accessible by the local municipality.
